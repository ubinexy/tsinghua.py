Make your Tsinghua campus life pythonic!

## What we've got

* thu_net.py : Dealing with campus network.

## What we'll have

* Lots. Most probably info/web learning bot. Certain functionalities will be developed but not published.

## How to use

Latest version of Python 2/3 will do. You also need the following 3rd-party libraries: [`requests`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests).

Read the function name and you'll know how to use :D

Seriously: I'll write more comment to help you with that. I'll also build a GUI (after learning how to).
